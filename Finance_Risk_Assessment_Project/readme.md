# Financial Risk Assessment Data Analysis

For my portfolio, I analysed a financial risk assessment dataset in CSV format, cleaning it in Excel by fixing data types, handling null values, and removing duplicates. I added a Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio column to assess financial risk, calculating it as Loan Amount / Asset Value. I addressed missing data by using N/A and adjusted currency formatting to ensure accurate calculations.

The cleaned data was then imported into Power BI, where I created several key visualisations:

*   **Distribution of Credit Scores (Histogram/Bar Chart):** Shows creditworthiness distribution.
*   **Loan Amount vs. Income (Scatter Plot):** Examines the correlation between loan amount and income.
*   **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Pie Chart):** Displays the reasons for loan applications.
*   **Loan-to-Value Ratio by Risk Rating (Stacked Bar Chart):** Visualises the relationship between LTV ratios and risk ratings.
*   **Debt-to-Income Ratio by Risk Rating (Clustered Bar Chart):** Assesses debt-to-income ratios against risk levels.
*   **Percentage of Defaults by Employment Status (Pie/Bar Chart):** Identifies default trends based on employment status.

This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, financial risk analysis, and creating insightful dashboards for data-driven decision-making.
