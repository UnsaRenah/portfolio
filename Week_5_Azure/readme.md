# Week 5 – Azure

During Week 5, I immersed myself in Microsoft Azure and key cloud computing concepts, gaining a strong foundation in Azure data fundamentals—essential knowledge for the DP900 exam. I began by exploring the critical role of cloud computing in modern business, contrasting it with traditional on-premises solutions. I compared popular cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, analysing the pros and cons of each.

I also delved into various cloud service models:

*   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
*   Platform as a Service (PaaS)
*   Software as a Service (SaaS)

Time was dedicated to understanding the importance of data protection and cybersecurity laws, such as the Computer Misuse Act (1990), Copyright, Design and Patents Act (1988), Data Protection Act (2018), and Consumer Rights Act (2015) and others.

To put theory into practice, I completed two labs: one focused on exploring relational data in Azure, and the other on non-relational data.

The final task was a business-oriented project for a company called "Paws and Whiskers." The business, which had been managing sales, customer, and inventory data manually or via spreadsheets, was looking to transition to Microsoft Azure to streamline data storage, analysis, and reporting for more informed decision-making. In my accompanying essay, I provided recommendations covering data laws and regulations, Azure service options, data types and modelling, storage formats and structures in Azure, and other key considerations.

This week not only enhanced my technical skills in Azure and cloud computing but also prepared me to support business transformations through effective data management and secure cloud solutions.
