# London Airbnb Analytics

The London Airbnb Analytics project involved cleaning the dataset in Excel before performing in-depth analysis in Power BI. I utilised Excel for data cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, filling missing values, and transforming data into a structured format. Then, I moved the cleaned data to Power BI, where I employed various visualisation techniques, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and slicers, to gain insights into trends in pricing, occupancy, and location. Key skills included:

*   **Excel data cleaning**
*   **Power BI data modelling**
*   **Visualisation creation**

This helped me understand market dynamics and derive data-driven conclusions.
