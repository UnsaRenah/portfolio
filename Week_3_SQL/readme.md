# Week 3: Diving into SQL and Database Management

During Week 3 of the boot camp, I was introduced to SQL and the foundational terminology and key concepts of databases. This module covered both relational and non-relational databases, as well as an overview of various data types. We learned how to write SQL code and how to join different tables together using various join types—self join, right/left join, inner join, cross join, and full join—each serving a distinct purpose in data retrieval.

## Group Assignment: Designing a Database for a Small Retail Business

In one group project, I contributed to a 500-word essay where we acted as consultants for a small retail business—a local corner shop selling a range of groceries and domestic products—that aimed to streamline its operations by creating a new database system. The system was intended to manage inventory, sales, and customer information. Our assignment involved:

*   Understanding the business requirements
*   Designing the database schema
*   Implementing the database
*   Populating the database
*   Maintaining the database

This task provided valuable insights into real-world scenarios and prepared me for future projects focused on optimizing business databases.

## Practical SQL Tasks with the World_DB Dataset

Next, I worked with the “World_DB” dataset, experimenting with different SQL syntaxes and documenting both the inputs and outputs. This task required me to join tables to extract specific pieces of information and answer several queries. As well as answering a range of questions using the SQL syntax we have been learning. For example:

*   Identified cities with high GDP per capita.

*   Displayed columns with a row limit (Rows 31-40).

These exercises deepened my understanding of SQL and its practical applications in answering complex data questions.
